    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Hey there! I'm Giulio, an adventurer at heart and a software developer by trade. 
      I dive into projects not just for work but for fun and growth, exploring new ideas and tech just to see where theyâ€™ll take me.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">I love experimenting with tools like Express.js, Vue, and Nuxt, and I'm constantly building side projects to keep learning and push my limits. 
      Follow me in my dev adventures as I tackle new challenges and share what I discover along the way!</p>
